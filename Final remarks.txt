The deadline for theoretical homeworks 3 and 4 is prolonged until January 31. You may send your scanned solutions to my e-mail. After February 1 I will publish statistics indicating successfully completed tasks by each of you. Please be precise in your solutions and highlight the final answer. 

You may freely use lecture materials, but they are not for public distribution.

It was a pleasure to deliver this course to you and if it would help you somehow in your future research work, I would be happy to hear that. Besides if you happen to be in Russia you also can write to me and I will suggest interesting places for visit. After rouble crashed 2 times lately, everything became 2 times cheaper for you here ;)

Best wishes,
Victor Kitov.
